# CredentialProvider
This iOS project demonstrates the implementation of an AutoFill Credential Provider, allowing the app to supply usernames and passwords automatically for websites and apps on iOS devices. The project showcases how to securely store and manage credentials within the iOS Keychain and provide these credentials through a custom interface when needed.

# Features
.Credential Management: Store and manage credentials securely using the iOS Keychain.
.Custom UI: Custom table view cell to display credentials.
.AutoFill Integration: Seamlessly integrate with iOS AutoFill to provide a smooth user experience.

# Usage
The app does not have a standard user interface as it operates as an extension. To test the functionality:

1.Navigate to a login form in Safari or any other app on your device.
2.Select the password field to trigger the AutoFill functionality.
3.Choose your credential provider from the options provided.
4.Select a credential to autofill the login details.
