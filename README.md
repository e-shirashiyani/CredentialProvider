# iOS AutoFill Credential Provider

This iOS project demonstrates an implementation of an AutoFill Credential Provider, allowing the application to automatically supply usernames and passwords for websites and apps on iOS devices. The project illustrates how to securely store and manage credentials within the iOS Keychain and provide these credentials through a custom interface when they are needed.

## Features

## Usage

Once the iOS AutoFill Credential Provider is installed and configured on your device, you can test and utilize its functionality as follows:

### Testing the Extension

1. **Open a Login Form**: On your iOS device, navigate to any login form available in Safari or within an app that supports AutoFill. This could be a social media site, a banking app, or any other service requiring login credentials.

2. **Invoke AutoFill**: Tap on the username or password field. The iOS keyboard will appear with a key icon on the top bar. Tap this icon to open the AutoFill suggestions.

3. **Select the Credential Provider**: If multiple credential providers are available, you might need to select the one corresponding to this project. It may be listed under a specific name you have set up in the extension's settings.

4. **Choose Credentials**: The extension will display a list of available credentials. Select the appropriate username. The extension will automatically fill in both the username and password for the selected account.

### Real-World Use
